WineCalculator
Instructions

A developer was hired by a Michelin-star restaurant to develop a calculator for the prices of their wine list. Normally, wine prices in restaurants are just 2-3x of their base price, but the restaurant Sommelier considers this almost a robbery. Instead, his proposal is a price scale where the percent margin decreases for higher tiers:

1. first 15€: 51%
2. 15-30€: 41%
3. 30-50€: 31%
4. 50€ or more: 21%
As an example, a wine with a base price of 35€ would be:

1. 7.65€ for the first 15€
2. 6.15€ for 15€ in the 15-30€ tier
3. 1.55€ for 5€ in the 3
4. margin: 15.35€
5. total price: 50.35€

Nevertheless, halfway on the job, the developer got too much involved with tasting the wines that he abandoned the project and was never heard of again. Your job is to finish the project, and add more tests so we ensure the calculator works properly.
